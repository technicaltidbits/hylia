I took a technical writing course towards the end of my senior year of college. It was an introductory technical writing course, and mostly covered the art of writing memos, resumes, and instructions. We wrote a feasibility report for our final project. 

After that class I realized that I was interested in technical writing, even though I'd declared a linguistics major. So after I finished my BA, I decided to apply for technical writing jobs. Here's what I offered:

1. A bachelor's degree
2. I can write!

Knowing what I know now, a bachelor's degree and the ability to write a paper about the syntax of Irish Gaelic was not enough. I could write well enough, but I had no technical skills or experience with popular documentation tools. If I'd learned the things I know now—about Git, SSGs, XML, topic-based authoring, testing, CI/CD—I might've had a stronger chance of finding a job after college. 

Technical communication programs should teach students about docs as code and the skills associated with it, like Git, JavaScript, GitHub, the command line, and markup languages. Or if anything, require them to take programming courses in addition to technical communications, editing, and design courses. A great final project might be building a documentation site and deploying it to Netlify, or writing a user manual using MadCap Flare.

Giving students a strong writing foundation (technical writing genres, style, editing, procedures, audience analysis, document design) *and* a decent technical foundation (markup languages, Git, docs as code processes) positions students for success no matter what industry they go into. 

I don't know how this would work, but I love the idea of creating a program where you spend the first half gaining a strong writing foundation and the latter half on the technical foundation.
