There's one thing that I never learned while I was studying for my technical writing certification. It's something that was rarely mentioned in any of the books that I read during my office hours back when I was teaching. It's about making *effective queries* as a techncial writer. 

I'm no seasoned technical writer (yet), but I can tell you that it's probably the most important skill a technical writer needs to learn.

Technical writers and editors communicate with subject matter experts (SMEs) on a regular basis. They often need to ask SMEs for clarification, to explain something in more detail, or to confirm information. This means asking plenty of questions. 

The only thing I never learned was *how* to ask those questions. When I first started, most of my questions were:

* Is this right?
* Is this wrong?

But what is "right?" And what is "wrong?" Am I looking for accuracy? Am I asking whether I explained this clearly? Did I use the correct terminology here? "Right" and "wrong" don't really seem to capture what I'm asking. 

## The solution

- asking for confirmation, "can you confirm..."
- is it accurate to say that...
