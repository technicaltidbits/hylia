I forget how I stumbled about the topic of testing documentation, but I think it had something to do with Write the Docs. I knew enough about testing code, but I didn't know there were tools out there to test documentation. After poking around with a few tools and linters, I've seen the light. And I want to share that light with you. 

## Testing docs 101

When software developers test their code, they may test the application's functionality or look for any security issues in their code. When technical writers test their docs, they may check to make sure that:

1. Links aren't broken - the URL is typed correctly
2. The documentation adheres to certain formatting
3. The writing adheres to a certain style (e.g. consistent capitalization and spelling, phrasing)
4. There are no spelling errors and that correct punctuation is used throughout the doc
5. It builds!

## Why do you need to test your docs?

Aside from the reasons listed above, there are three reasons why you should test your documentation. 

### 1. Consistent formatting = positive user experience

- Consistency = happy users / inconsistency = unhappy users

### 2. Catch those bugs before you deploy your docs

- Typos are more important that you think.

### 3. Testing tools can save you time

- Can be automated into your CI process. Identifies bugs quicker than a manual review process.
