To install Vale on your computer, you'll need to use a package manager. Package managers allow you to install and update packages and libraries. 

Windows users can install Vale using [**Chocolatey**][Chocolatey link]. If you've already installed Chocolatey, skip to [step two](#heading-step-two:-install-vale). Otherwise, continue reading the instructions below.

## Step two: Install Vale

1. From the terminal, run the command `choco install vale`. You'll see some output in the terminal as Chocolatey installs Vale on your computer.
