To install Vale on your computer, you'll need to use a package manager. Package managers allow you to install and update packages and libraries. 

The best package manager for macOS is [**Homebrew**][Homebrew link]. If you've already installed Homebrew, skip to [step two](#heading-step-two:-install-vale). Otherwise, continue reading the instructions below.

## Step one: Install Homebrew 

1. To install Homebrew, enter this command into the terminal (feel free to copy and paste):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)".
```

1. To verify that you installed Homebrew, run the command `brew help`. If the installation was successful, the command prints the help documentation to the terminal.

## Step two: Install Vale 

1. From the terminal, run the command `brew install vale`. You'll see some output in the terminal as Homebrew installs Vale.

2. Verify that the `vale` command is now available by running `vale -v` in the terminal. If the installation was successful, the command reports the latest, stable version of Vale.
